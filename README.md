# winFlashcards

winFlashcards is an open-source free Windows Desktop application which lets you create digital flashcards to help you in your study.

"Flashcards" are just a piece of paper with a question on the front and the answer on the back.

This is just a little free-time project I am developing for my little sister who just started university! She brought me up with this study method and told me how all the free tools she tried were not adequate. I found it nice to start this mini-project for her. ‚ù£Ô∏è

The project is written in Dart+Flutter SDK.
 
Nothing advanced here... just 10mins of coding here and there.
